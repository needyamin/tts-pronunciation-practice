## File Structure

```

## How It Works

1. **IPA Dictionary**: The app downloads a comprehensive CMU dictionary with 170,000+ English words and their IPA transcriptions
2. **Multiple Sources**: For words not in the main dictionary, it checks custom corrections and falls back to the eng-to-ipa library
3. **Text-to-Speech**: Uses pyttsx3 with Microsoft Zira voice (if available) for clear pronunciation
4. **Subprocess Isolation**: Each TTS session runs in a separate Python process for complete isolation and reliability
5. **Background Operation**: Runs in system tray with ultra-fast clipboard monitoring for seamless workflow
6. **Instant Stop**: Subprocess-based approach allows immediate termination of speech with no lingering state issues

## Auto-Update System

The application includes a comprehensive auto-update system:

### Automatic Updates
- **Startup Check**: Automatically checks for updates 2 seconds after application launch
- **Rate Limiting**: Only checks once per hour to avoid excessive API calls
- **Background Processing**: Update checks run in background threads without blocking the UI

### Manual Updates
- **Update Button**: Click "üîÑ Check for Updates" in the main interface
- **System Tray**: Right-click tray icon and select "Check for Updates"
- **Status Feedback**: Shows "Checking for updates..." message during manual checks

### Update Dialog
When an update is available, a beautiful dialog appears with:
- **Version Comparison**: Shows current vs. new version
- **Release Notes**: Scrollable text with detailed update information
- **Download Options**: Direct link to GitHub release page
- **Skip Option**: Choose to skip the update for now

### Configuration
The update system is configured via constants in `speak.py`:
```python
REPO_OWNER = "needyamin"
REPO_NAME = "tts-pronunciation-practice"
CURRENT_VERSION = "1.0.0"  # Update this when releasing new versions
```

### GitHub Integration
- **API Endpoint**: Uses GitHub Releases API for version checking
- **Release Tags**: Expects version tags in format `v1.0.1`, `v1.1.0`, etc.
- **Release Notes**: Displays the release body text in the update dialog
- **Download Links**: Provides direct links to GitHub release pages

## Building Executable

### Quick Build (Recommended)

```bash
python build.py
```

This will:
- **Automatically install all requirements** from requirements.txt
- **Install PyInstaller** if needed
- **Download the IPA dictionary** if not present
- **Ask for build type**: Portable or Installer
- **Create standalone executable** and/or professional installer

### Build Options

When you run `python build.py`, you'll be prompted to choose:

#### Option 1: Portable Executable
- Creates a standalone `.exe` file
- No installation required
- Ready to run immediately
- Output: `portable/TTS_Pronunciation_Practice.exe`

#### Option 2: Professional Installer
- Creates both portable `.exe` and professional installer
- Requires Inno Setup 6 (automatically detected)
- Modern Windows installation wizard
- Desktop shortcuts, Start Menu integration
- Output: 
  - `dist/TTS_Pronunciation_Practice.exe` (portable)
  - `installer/TTS_Pronunciation_Practice_Setup.exe` (installer)

### Inno Setup Installation

For the professional installer option, you'll need Inno Setup 6:

1. **Download Inno Setup 6**: [https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
2. **Install Inno Setup 6** on your system
3. **Run the build script again**: `python build.py`

The build script will automatically detect Inno Setup and create a professional installer.

### Manual Build (Advanced)

If you prefer manual control:

```bash
# Install requirements manually
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller

# Build executable
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name=TTS_Pronunciation_Practice speak.py
```

## Customization

### Adding Custom IPA Pronunciations

Edit the `CUSTOM_IPA` dictionary in `speak.py`:

```python
CUSTOM_IPA = {
    "yamin": "j…ëÀêÀàmiÀên",
    "million": "Ààm…™l.j…ôn",
    "billion": "Ààb…™l.j…ôn",
    "yourword": "Ààj…îÀêr.w…úÀêrd"
}
```

### Voice Settings

Modify voice properties in the code:

```python
engine.setProperty('rate', 150)  # Speed (words per minute)
# Change voice selection logic for different voices
```

### Version Management

To release a new version:

1. **Update Version Number**: Change `CURRENT_VERSION` in `speak.py`:
   ```python
   CURRENT_VERSION = "1.0.1"  # Increment version number
   ```

2. **Create GitHub Release**: 
   - Tag the release with version (e.g., `v1.0.1`)
   - Add release notes in the description
   - Upload the new executable files

3. **Build New Executable**: Run `python build.py` to create updated executables

The auto-update system will automatically detect the new version and notify users.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No sound**: Check your system's audio settings and ensure pyttsx3 is properly installed
2. **Missing IPA**: Some words may not have IPA transcriptions available
3. **Clipboard not working**: Ensure pyperclip is installed and clipboard access is allowed
4. **System tray not showing**: Check if pystray is properly installed
5. **Multiple tray icons**: The app now ensures only one tray icon exists

### Voice Issues

If the default voice doesn't work well:
- The app tries to use Microsoft Zira voice
- You can modify the voice selection logic in the code
- Different systems may have different available voices

### Debug Mode

The application includes debug output to help troubleshoot issues:
- Check console output for `[DEBUG]` messages
- These show clipboard detection, word processing, and speech status

## Development

### Adding Features

The code is well-structured and modular. Key areas for extension:
- `speak_text()`: Main pronunciation logic
- `clipboard_monitor()`: Clipboard detection
- `setup_tray()`: System tray functionality
- `update_history_ui()`: History display
