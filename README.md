## How It Works

1. **IPA Dictionary**: The app uses a comprehensive CMU dictionary with 170,000+ English words and their IPA transcriptions
2. **Multiple Sources**: For words not in the main dictionary, it checks custom corrections and falls back to the eng-to-ipa library
3. **Text-to-Speech**: Uses pyttsx3 with Microsoft Zira voice (if available) for clear pronunciation
4. **Subprocess Isolation**: Each TTS session runs in a separate Python process for complete isolation and reliability
5. **Background Operation**: Runs in system tray with ultra-fast clipboard monitoring for seamless workflow
6. **Instant Stop**: Subprocess-based approach allows immediate termination of speech with no lingering state issues
7. **Auto Start**: Optionally launches automatically on Windows login (enable in Settings)

## Auto-Update System

- **Startup Check**: Automatically checks for updates after application launch
- **Manual Updates**: Click "Check for Updates" in the Help menu
- **Update Dialog**: Shows current vs. new version, release notes, and download/install options
- **Silent/Automatic Update**: Optionally downloads and installs the latest version automatically

## Building Executable

- Run `python build.py` to build a portable EXE and/or installer
- Output EXE: `build_exe/dist/TTS_Pronunciation_Practice.exe`
- Output Installer: `build_exe/build_exe/installer/TTS_Pronunciation_Practice_Setup.exe`

## Troubleshooting

- **No sound**: Check your system's audio settings and ensure pyttsx3 is properly installed
- **Clipboard not working**: Ensure pyperclip is installed and clipboard access is allowed
- **System tray not showing**: Check if pystray is properly installed
- **Auto start not working**: Ensure pywin32 is installed and you have permission to create shortcuts
