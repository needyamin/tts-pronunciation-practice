## How It Works

1. **IPA Dictionary**: The app downloads a comprehensive CMU dictionary with 170,000+ English words and their IPA transcriptions
2. **Multiple Sources**: For words not in the main dictionary, it checks custom corrections and falls back to the eng-to-ipa library
3. **Text-to-Speech**: Uses pyttsx3 with Microsoft Zira voice (if available) for clear pronunciation
4. **Background Operation**: Runs in system tray with ultra-fast clipboard monitoring for seamless workflow
5. **Thread-Safe**: Speech synthesis runs in separate threads to prevent GUI freezing

## Building Executable

### Quick Build (Recommended)

```bash
python build.py
```

This will:
- **Automatically install all requirements** from requirements.txt
- **Install PyInstaller** if needed
- **Download the IPA dictionary** if not present
- **Ask for build type**: Portable or Installer
- **Create standalone executable** and/or professional installer

### Build Options

When you run `python build.py`, you'll be prompted to choose:

#### Option 1: Portable Executable
- Creates a standalone `.exe` file
- No installation required
- Ready to run immediately
- Output: `portable/TTS_Pronunciation_Practice.exe`

#### Option 2: Professional Installer
- Creates both portable `.exe` and professional installer
- Requires Inno Setup 6 (automatically detected)
- Modern Windows installation wizard
- Desktop shortcuts, Start Menu integration
- Output: 
  - `dist/TTS_Pronunciation_Practice.exe` (portable)
  - `installer/TTS_Pronunciation_Practice_Setup.exe` (installer)

### Inno Setup Installation

For the professional installer option, you'll need Inno Setup 6:

1. **Download Inno Setup 6**: [https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
2. **Install Inno Setup 6** on your system
3. **Run the build script again**: `python build.py`

The build script will automatically detect Inno Setup and create a professional installer.

### Manual Build (Advanced)

If you prefer manual control:

```bash
# Install requirements manually
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller

# Build executable
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name=TTS_Pronunciation_Practice speak.py
```

## Customization

### Adding Custom IPA Pronunciations

Edit the `CUSTOM_IPA` dictionary in `speak.py`:

```python
CUSTOM_IPA = {
    "yamin": "j…ëÀêÀàmiÀên",
    "million": "Ààm…™l.j…ôn",
    "billion": "Ààb…™l.j…ôn",
    "yourword": "Ààj…îÀêr.w…úÀêrd"
}
```

### Voice Settings

Modify voice properties in the code:

```python
engine.setProperty('rate', 150)  # Speed (words per minute)
# Change voice selection logic for different voices
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No sound**: Check your system's audio settings and ensure pyttsx3 is properly installed
2. **Missing IPA**: Some words may not have IPA transcriptions available
3. **Clipboard not working**: Ensure pyperclip is installed and clipboard access is allowed
4. **System tray not showing**: Check if pystray is properly installed
5. **Multiple tray icons**: The app now ensures only one tray icon exists

### Voice Issues

If the default voice doesn't work well:
- The app tries to use Microsoft Zira voice
- You can modify the voice selection logic in the code
- Different systems may have different available voices

### Debug Mode

The application includes debug output to help troubleshoot issues:
- Check console output for `[DEBUG]` messages
- These show clipboard detection, word processing, and speech status

## Development

### Adding Features

The code is well-structured and modular. Key areas for extension:
- `speak_text()`: Main pronunciation logic
- `clipboard_monitor()`: Clipboard detection
- `setup_tray()`: System tray functionality
- `update_history_ui()`: History display
